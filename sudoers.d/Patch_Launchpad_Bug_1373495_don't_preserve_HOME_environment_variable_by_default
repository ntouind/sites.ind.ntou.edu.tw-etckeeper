# Currently Ubuntu hard-coded sudo to preserve HOME environment variable to point to sudo caller's home directory by default(refer Launchpad bug #760140) however this is dangerous and error-prone because the program run by root may write files (e.g. $HOME/.Xauthority , program config files) into the HOME directory **AS ROOT** which, will cause issue when users run the same program as themselves and even make the user failed to login(due to .Xauthority file owner is incorrect)
